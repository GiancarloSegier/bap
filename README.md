## Briefing

This is a briefing commissioned by Think Pink vzw. Think Pink works with breast cancer patients on a daily basis, both nationally and internationally. This briefing is aimed at Race for the Cure, the largest sporting event in Europe in the fight against breast cancer.

## Context

In the past 12 years, Think Pink vzw has worked hard on the road to fight against breast cancer with a wider audience. In addition to scientific research, funds are also collected for exercise programs, for care and aftercare projects of all kinds, for active support to fellow sufferers.

With more than 10,000 new diagnoses per year and an average of 7 women who die of breast cancer, this remains a major challenge for our society.

Luckily we keep the disease under better control and the chances of healing increase year after year. But there is still a lot to do and certainly in the area of prevention.The link to a healthy lifestyle is just about the most important thing you can do yourself, along with having yourself checked in time for signals or when you are in the target group for a regular check. So a lot of focus on that.

## Challenge

One of the events that remains important in this is the Race for the Cure; an international concept that in the meantime is being organized by Think Pink in many European cities. Think Pink Europe was created for this in 2018. An extra organization to promote the international character of the struggle, but also to develop formats and communication internationally.

In an increasingly smaller world, targeted communication plays an increasingly important role. The Race for the Cure (3 km walking) , 6 km walk, health village) plays a central role in the fight against breast cancer. With 22 Races and 230,000 participants in 2019, we not only reached many participants, but also a great deal of communication was directed towards citizens and relevant bodies. But everything can be better.

Being active on an international playing field also requires a more complex and innovative approach. However, the digital world means much more opportunities in this area. But this still remains an immense challenge. A lot is possible, but the complexity (languages, cultural differences, levels of digitization, accessibility of media, ...) and the limited resources somewhat inhibit the possibilities. All the more reason to take innovation paths in order to use communication to a large audience for such an event and thus make the fight against breast cancer stronger.

## Race for the Cure

The Race for the Cure will take place in 30 cities in 2020 (from St Petersburg in Russia to Tenerife in Spain, from Athens in Greece to Sarajevo in Bosnia: see www.thinkpinkeurope.org for all details).

The focus of the event is on the pre-communication that already starts in the spring and peaks at the end of September with the largest number of Races in one day, the Sunday before October which is international breast cancer month. In 2020 we also want to play this event with more than 300,000 participants communicatively as the largest sports event in Europe.

## Conclusion

Use digital communication, in the broadest and most innovative way possible, to communicate internationally / European about the Race for the Cure as an event, to make the fight against breast cancer stronger.

# Research question

After a lot of research and reading more about our targetgroup, we came up with this research question:

> **How can we improve communication between the organizers of a Race for The Cure event in Europe in order to be able to guide them in an accessible and understandable way in organizing the event?**
